we can use AWS Glue crawler.
A crawler is a process that is going to
traverse our data and try to extract a schema out of it.
Then, once it's done, it will have
a database and a table there that you can
use with other AWS services like Athena.
So the creation of our Glue crawler is rather simple.
In our case, we just specify the path in
an S3 bucket and give it
a role that has access to that bucket,
and can create tables and databases on Glue.
So once we have that,
we can start actually querying that data.
I mentioned Athena, you can actually take Quicksight
to have visualizations on
data that is being created by Athena.
This is the schema that was
extracted from the public dataset.
We see all of the columns that are there.
We're going to focus on review body, which is the text,
and product category, which
is what we're going to try to predict,
also called the target.
